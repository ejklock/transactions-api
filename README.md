# Fastify Project with Node 20, TypeScript, ts-up, and Knex

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of my studies on using Fastify, a fast and low-latency web framework for Node.js, along with end-to-end (E2E) testing using Vitest. The application is built with Node 20 and TypeScript, and uses ts-up for build management. Additionally, Knex is employed for user transaction management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js 20**: The latest version of Node.js, ensuring performance and updated features.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript, making code maintenance easier and preventing common errors.
- **Fastify**: A web framework focused on high performance and efficiency.
- **ts-up**: A build tool for TypeScript, simplifying the build and deployment process.
- **Knex**: A SQL query builder for JavaScript, used to interact with the database and manage user transactions.
- **Vitest**: An E2E testing tool, ensuring application quality and functionality through automated tests.
